An introductory level project that uses Sinatra to build a number-guessing game.

It's able to:
* Generate a random number on startup
* Have a web page where you can enter a guess
* Tell you whether your guess was...
* Way too high
* Too high
* Correct
* Too low
* Way too low
* Change the page's colors based on how far from the target the guess is
* Track guesses and start a new game when a user exceeds their max amount of guesses.
